# Homepage of Hai Hu

My name is 胡 (Hu) 海 (Hai), but in English people say it in the reverse way, which sounds more like: Hi! Who?

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics and Translation at City University of Hong Kong, starting Aug 2025. 

My research interests:
1. Benchmarking (L)LMs on Chinese (esp. all kinds of reasoning abilities)
2. BabyLM: training small LMs in controlled settings to study the learning dynamics and their alignment with kids/human language learning
3. Cognitive science: computational modeling for psycho- and neuro-linguistics
4. Chinese linguistics, treebanking, translation studies, etc.

I like building datasets and training models for Chinese NLP. I am a founding member of [CLUE](https://github.com/CLUEbenchmark/CLUE), one of the first evaluation suites for Chinese NLU, which includes 
some benchmarks we made, for instance, a reasoning dataset in Chinese: [OCNLI](https://github.com/CLUEbenchmark/OCNLI).
More recently, we constructed the first benchmark on conversational implicature in Chinese, based on the sitcom 武林外传, [SwordsmanImp](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19509),
the most comprehensive minimal pair benchmark for Chinese syntax, [ZhoBLiMP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06096), among several others. 
We conducted the first comprehensive study in China to examine whether EFL (English as Foreign Language) instructors can detect GPT-written essays ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07666)), and released a sentence-level detector of AI-written argumentative essays.
