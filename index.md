# Homepage of Hai Hu

My name is 胡 (Hu) 海 (Hai), but in English people say it in the reverse way, which sounds more like: Hi! Who?

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics and Translation at City University of Hong Kong, starting Aug 2025. 

Previously, I was Assistant Professor in the School of Foreign Languages at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2021-2025).

I work in the field of Computational Linguistics (or Natural Language Processing), which involves building, evaluating and interpreting computational models that understand and produce human languages. 

I received my PhD degree in (Computational) Linguistics from the Department of Linguistics at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://linguistics.indiana.edu/){:target="_blank"} (IU). 
I was very lucky to be advised by [Larry Moss](https://iulg.sitehost.iu.edu/moss/){:target="_blank"} (Math) and [Sandra Kübler](https://cl.indiana.edu/~skuebler/){:target="_blank"} (Computational Linguistics). I also work closely with [Chien-Jer Charles Lin](https://ealc.indiana.edu/people/lin-chien-jer-charles.html) and [Patrícia Amaral](https://spanport.indiana.edu/about/faculty/amaral-patricia.html) at IU. 

Before IU, I got my BA in English and MA in English linguistics at [Renmin University of China](http://www.ruc.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"}. I spent one year at [Universität Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/university.html){:target="_blank"} as an exchange student and learned some [Schwäbisch](https://www.schwaebisch-schwaetza.de/schwaebisch_woerterbuch.html){:target="_blank"} German :)

Chengdu is my hometown, which is also home to pandas :panda_face:, hot pot :stew:, all kinds of spicy and non-spicy food, and :mahjong:.
 
My research interests: natural language inference, Chinese linguistics, language variation and change, natural language understanding corpus annotation, stylistic properties of translations. See my [Publications (mostly up to date)](publications/) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G2RN6qMAAAAJ&hl=en) page for papers and more information. 

**OUR LAB is constangly HIRING** students who are interested in computational linguistics.
