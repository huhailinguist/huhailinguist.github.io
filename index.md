# Homepage of Hai

My name is 胡 (Hu) 海 (Hai), but in English people say it in the reverse way, which sounds more like: Hi! Who?
 
I’m a Ph.D. student in (Computational) Linguistics at [Indiana University Bloomington](http://www.indiana.edu/~lingdept/){:target="_blank"}. Before coming to IU, I finished my BA in English and MA in English linguistics at [Renmin University of China](http://www.ruc.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"}. I was also very lucky to spend one year at Universität Tübingen as an exchange student and learned some [Schwäbisch](https://www.schwaebisch-schwaetza.de/schwaebisch_woerterbuch.html){:target="_blank"} German :)

Chengdu is my hometown, which is also home to pandas, hot pot and all kinds of spicy and non-spicy food.
 
My research interests: Chinese linguistics, parsing, syntactic differences among different texts. See my [Publication & projects](projects/) page for more information.
