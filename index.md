# Homepage of Hai Hu

My name is 胡 (Hu) 海 (Hai), but in English people say it in the reverse way, which sounds more like: Hi! Who?

In Fall 2021, I am starting as an Assistant Professor in the English Department at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

I received my PhD degree in (Computational) Linguistics from the Department of Linguistics at [Indiana University Bloomington](http://www.indiana.edu/~lingdept/){:target="_blank"} (IU). Before IU, I got my BA in English and MA in English linguistics at [Renmin University of China](http://www.ruc.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"}. I was also very lucky to spend one year at [Universität Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/university.html){:target="_blank"} as an exchange student and learned some [Schwäbisch](https://www.schwaebisch-schwaetza.de/schwaebisch_woerterbuch.html){:target="_blank"} German :)

Chengdu is my hometown, which is also home to pandas :panda_face:, hot pot :stew: and all kinds of spicy and non-spicy food (and :mahjong:).
 
My research interests: natural language inference, Chinese linguistics, language variation and change, natural language understanding corpus annotation, stylistic properties of translations. See my [Publications (mostly up to date)](publications/) or [Research projects (should be outdated already)](projects/) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G2RN6qMAAAAJ&hl=en) page for papers and more information.
