The computational linguistics (CL) lab at School of Foreign Languages (SFL), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)
studies:

1) various aspects (mostly syntax, semantics and pragmatics) of human languages through computational modelling 
2) Natural Language Processing, with a specific focus on benchmarking language models in language understanding
3) comparing language acquisition in humans and language models

Our lab is equipped with several deep learning servers for training and evaluating state-of-the-art language models. Currently we have two master students and several undergraduate students working in the lab. They come from diverse backgrounds: linguistics, computer science, information engineering, translation, language studies (English, German, Chinese), etc.

We are actively recruiting students interested in computational linguistics and related areas!

欢迎对计算语言学/自然语言处理/语料库语言学/机器翻译/认知科学感兴趣的本科同学加入本组！ 特别欢迎有计算机或心理学、认知科学背景的同学。
欢迎有意读硕士（语言学学硕、翻译专硕）的同学联系我！
