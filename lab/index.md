The computational linguistics (CL) lab at Dept of Linguistics and Translation, CityUHK
studies:

1) various aspects (e.g., syntax, semantics and pragmatics) of human languages through computational modelling 
2) Natural Language Processing, with a focus on evaluating language models with linguistically oriented benchmarks
3) comparing language acquisition in humans and language models

Our lab is equipped with several deep learning servers for training and evaluating state-of-the-art language models. Currently we have two master students and several undergraduate students working in the lab. They come from diverse backgrounds: linguistics, computer science, information engineering, translation, language studies (English, German, Chinese), etc.

We are actively recruiting students interested in computational linguistics and related areas!

香港城市大学计算语言学实验室研究方向包括：

1. 通过计算建模研究人类语言的各个方面，包括但不限于：句法、语义、语用
2. 自然语言处理，主要集中在建设以语言学知识为基础的评测，用以评测语言模型
3. 对比人类学习与机器学习的异同

本实验室配备多个服务器，用于大语言模型的训练和推理。实验室成员背景各异，包括语言学、计算机、翻译、信息工程、英德汉语等。

欢迎对计算语言学/自然语言处理/语料库语言学/机器翻译/认知科学感兴趣的本科同学加入本组！ 特别欢迎有计算机或心理学、认知科学背景的同学。
欢迎有意攻读CityUHK博士学位的同学联系我！
