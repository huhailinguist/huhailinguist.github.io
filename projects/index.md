## Usage of English acronyms in Chinese text

In this project, I'm mainly concerned with the usage of English acronyms such as 'GDP', 'WTO' in Chinese. Many have expressed worries about the "contamination" of Chinese by incoming English acronyms and words, but very few descriptive studies have been done. The following are some of the first attempts to quanfity the degree of acronym usage and possible factors that drive language users to prefer "GDP" rather than "国民生产总值".

## Chinese segmentation and parsing

- We show that outputting _k_ best segmentations and passing all of them to a lattice parser will benefit both word segmentation and parsing, compared to traditional method of passing only the best segmentation to the parser.
