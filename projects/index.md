## Stylistic features of original and translated Chinese

We use corpus and computational methods to explore lexical, syntactic and discourse-level features of (human) translated Chinese, compared with original Chinese. The broader goal is to analyze and understand *translationese*, or *翻译腔*. 

This is joint work with Chien-Jer Charles Lin, Sandra Kübler, Wen Li, and others. Particularly, Ruoze Huang (黄若泽) from Xiamen University/The Chinese University of Hong Kong first suggested this project and has helped in corpus compilation and data analysis. 

Currently we have the following papers, abstracts accepted or in prep.

## Natural language inference

This project uses natural logic to answer textual entailment questions such as: if we know that 'All students party on New Year's Eve' and that 'Most students get drunk in every party', does it follow that 'Most PhD students get drunk on New Year's Eve'? We use monotonicity calculus and Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) to solve these problems. 

The second paper below describes how we polarize the words and phrases in a sentence; the third paper discusses how our (still-developing) inference system works.

## Usage of English acronyms in Chinese text

In this project, I'm mainly concerned with the usage of English acronyms such as 'GDP', 'WTO' in Chinese. Many have expressed worries about the "contamination" of Chinese by incoming English acronyms and words, but very few descriptive studies have been done. The following are some of the first attempts to quanfity the degree of acronym usage and possible factors that drive language users to prefer "GDP" rather than "国民生产总值".

## Chinese segmentation and parsing

We show that outputting _k_ best segmentations and passing all of them to a lattice parser will benefit both word segmentation and parsing, compared to traditional method of passing only the best segmentation to the parser:
