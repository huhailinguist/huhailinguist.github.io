abstract="We present the results of shared-task 1 held in the 2020 Conference on Natural Language Processing and Chinese Computing (NLPCC): Light Pre-Trained Chinese Language Model for NLP tasks. This shared-task examines the performance of light language models on four common NLP tasks: Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Anaphora Resolution and Machine Reading Comprehension. To make sure that the models are light-weight, we put restrictions and requirements on the number of parameters and inference speed of the participating models. In total, 30 teams registered our tasks. Each submission was evaluated through our online benchmark system (https://www.cluebenchmarks.com/nlpcc2020.html), with the average score over the four tasks as the final score. Various ideas and frameworks were explored by the participants, including data enhancement, knowledge distillation and quantization. The best model achieved an average score of 75.949, which was very close to BERT-base (76.460). We believe this shared-task highlights the potential of light-weight models and calls for further research on the development and exploration of light-weight models.",
